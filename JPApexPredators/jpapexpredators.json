It attacks one of the team members and they are forced to shoot it. They don’t appear then until far later in the film when Ellie and Muldoon have to restore the park’s power systems. Muldoon realises they’re being hunted by them and tells Ellie to run to the power shed as he tracks a Velociraptor with his gun. She restores the power and finds what’s left of Ray and she narrowly escapes from a Velociraptor. Muldoon is still tracking a raptor when the female ambushes him, killing him. The raptors appear again in the visitor center when Lex and Tim are eating. They hide in the kitchen and avoid being detected. They managed to trap one of them and escape. The raptors catch up with the group in the control room so Ellie, Dr. Grant, Tim and Lex escape through the vents and into the main lobby area of the visitor center. They fall to the ground and are about to be attacked by two Velociraptors when the Tyrannosaur appears, killing both of them. The survivors use this opportunity to escape the island."

One of the raptors jumps on Sarah’s backpack and Sarah and Kelly flee into a nearby building with two raptors in pursuit. Malcolm tires to evade the other one by hiding in a nearby building and then inside a car. The other two velociraptors make it inside the building and Sarah and Kelly climb to the top.

				"scene_description": "The film starts off with Dr. Grant and his colleague Billy discussing a Velociraptor’s communicative intelligence. Billy uses a 3D printer to replicate the larynx of a Velociraptor. When Dr. Grant and the group get stranded on the island, his colleague Billy steals two Velociraptor eggs unknown to the others. When the survivors reach the abandoned laboratory, a raptor sneaks in there and attacks Amanda Kirby. The group runs to the cages and traps one of them. We see its communicative abilities when it actually calls the other Velociraptors for help. The survivors run through a group of Corythosaurus and Parasaurolophus and into the forest. Amanda, Paul and Billy hide in the trees while Dr. Grant is still on the ground. The raptors injure Udesky and set a trap to lure the others down from the tree. Amanda Kirby almost falls from the tree but is saved and Dr. Grant is confronted by a Velociraptor. Eric Kirby comes to his rescue and sprays a gas can and the raptors flee.\n\nWe then see the raptors at the climax of the movie when the survivors are making their way back to the beach. The Velociraptors surround the group and the female raptor challenges Amanda Kirby for the eggs that Billy stole earlier. She hands over the eggs and Dr. Grant uses the imitation raptor larynx to fool the raptors into running off. The survivors then escape the island."

				"scene_description": "In Jurassic World, a pack of Velociraptors each with their own names, Blue, Charlie, Delta, and Echo, are trained by Owen Grady. These raptors each have their unique personalities and skin colors and even head anatomy. InGen, the company that cloned the dinosaurs, wants to use the raptors for military applications. This is also the first time raptors developed a personal bond with humans.\n\nVic Hoskins convinced the IBRIS Project trainers to utilize the raptors in the pursuit of an escaped Indominus rex. But the raptors began to attack humans as the Indominus rex had raptor DNA and became their alpha. In the chaos, Charlie was blown to bits by a rocket launcher. Delta and Echo then tried to eat Claire Dearing, Gray, and Zach Mitchell in their van. Sometime later, Delta suddenly appeared in the Hammond Creation Lab unexpectedly before Owen, Claire, Hoskins, and the boys. They are forced to flee after the raptor killed Hoskins, who failed at trying to calm her down by copying Owen's hand gesture. After killing Hoskins, Delta continued her pursuit of Owen, Claire and the boys before being distracted by a hologram of a Dilophosaurus activated by Gray, but continued her pursuit after realizing it wasn't real.\n\nSoon it turned out Blue herded the humans into a trap. Just as they trapped the humans, the Indominus walked into view. The raptors, however, turned on the Indominus as Owen takes off the video camera from Blue's head, realizing that the hybrid was merely using them. As they refought the Indominus with Owen's help, Blue was knocked unconscious while the other raptors were overpowered. Later, Blue regained consciousness and rejoined the fight, lunging at the hybrid and allowing Jurassic World's T. rex that was from the original Jurassic Park park who had joined the battle in her absence, to get back on her feet after she was pushed to the ground by the Indominus rex. Blue helped the T. rex attack the I. rex. Suddenly, the Mosasaurus dragged the I. rex into the bottom of the lagoon. After the fight, the T. rex decides to spare Blue, most likely due to the already extensive injuries caused by Indominus. Blue then turned towards Owen, chirping at him momentarily before disappearing into the night."

				"scene_description": "Blue the raptor returns in the film Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, making her the first returning Velociraptor character. At the beginning of the movie, it shows Owen Grady watching a training video of him, and her pack as infants on a computer. Early in the story, it is revealed that Blue is still alive but she and many other creatures lives are in danger from the impending eruption of Mount Sibo. The decide to attempt a rescue mission to save Blue, the last surviving Velociraptor.\n\nDuring the rescue mission, Blue was reunited with Owen by startling him when she screeches loudly at him from behind, perched on top of the damaged Jurassic Park Ford tour van that Alan Grant rescued Tim Murphy from, in a greeting. As she slowly approaches him, she begins to press her nose to his palm, remembering him, before jerking her head away with a sharp cry as Ken Wheatley and a team of mercenaries attempts to capture Blue via tranquilizing her. Owen warns them to back up after they refused to wait for his signal to tranquilize her until Blue attacks one of the nearby soldiers, which results in her getting shot in the hip. She gives a wail of pain before falling over onto her side.\n\nOnce Owen is tranquilized by Wheatley after she is shot, Zia Rodriguez rushes to her rescue, telling the mercenaries that she is the only one who can keep Blue alive. She and Blue are subsequently captured, and taken to the East Dock, where Wheatley and the other animal traffickers have captured the other dinosaurs to ship them back to the mainland for Eli Mills and Henry Wu.\n\nInside the back of a military van, Zia and Blue reunite with Owen, Claire, and Franklin to reveal that Blue is hemorrhaging, and will need a blood transfusion from a carnivore with two or three fingers to keep her alive. Owen and Claire end up bringing back blood from the Tyrannosaurus rex, which subsequently saves her life.\n\nAround the same time, Maisie Lockwood watches a training video with Blue as an infant, showing compassion and empathy for Owen, while he pretends to show signs of weakness in front of her.\n\nAfter the Indoraptor's escape, Henry Wu has Franklin, who is disguised as a geneticist to get equipment for him to take blood samples from Blue to create a new batch of Indoraptors, which would subsequently become her children. The plan, however, backfires, as Zia breaks the news to him that Blue's blood is transfused with the Tyrannosaur's, and Franklin stabs him in the neck with a tranquilizer. Two ACU troops attempt to subdue them before Zia releases Blue, who mauls them both, before escaping from the laboratory as it erupts in flames from one of the soldiers' bullets hitting a tank of flammable, toxic, gas.\n\nBlue, after making her way upstairs inside the Lockwood Manor, attacks the Indoraptor in Maisie's bedroom when she sees him preparing to attack Owen. The two battle for a brief moment before they both fall out of a window, with Blue falling in another direction as the Indoraptor continues to pursue Owen and Maisie.\n\nBlue then ambushes the Indoraptor from behind on the roof, pouncing on him. The added weight causes them to fall through the skylight, and land on an Agujaceratops skull, which impales, and kills, the Indoraptor. After giving a shriek of victory, Blue jumps off and runs off.\n\nAfter the dinosaurs from Nublar are released into the open by Maisie, Blue is approached by Owen, who tells her that he can take her to a sanctuary she would be safe at. However, Blue ends up running off, pausing briefly to look back at Owen, making a gentle noise towards him, before running off into the early morning.\n\nAt the ending of the film, it shows Blue overlooking a far-off, suburban, Californian neighborhood, as she calls out."

                "scene_description": "In the four years since the 2018 Dinosaur Outbreak, Blue has settled in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and has had a daughter named Beta through asexual reproduction due to the monitor lizard DNA used in Blue's creation. Blue's nest is located in an old bus close to where Owen Grady is living with Claire Dearing and Maisie Lockwood and, although the humans appear to be unaware that Blue is living close by, she is seen observing them from a distance. Blue attempts to hunt a rabbit with her daughter but the small mammal is killed by a solitary wolf. The raptors then attack and kill the wolf, while their roars can be heard next to Owen's home.\n\nIn the extended edition of Jurassic World: Dominion, there is a scene in which after Beta killed the wolf, she is immediately targeted by a couple of hunters, causing Blue to rush towards and killed them.\n\nOne day, Beta wanders onto Owen's property where Maisie attempts to make friends with her before an agitated Blue shows up, none too pleased by her daughter or Maisie's actions. Owen manages to calm his old friend who runs off into the woods with Beta. However, Blue and Beta are ambushed by poachers led by Rainn Delacourt who kidnap Maisie and Beta and run Blue off of the road. Enraged by her daughter's kidnapping, Blue returns to Owen's home where he recognizes that she could potentially kill them in her agitated state with Blue even striking down his outstretched hand, leaving it with a scar. Nonetheless, Owen manages to calm Blue down again and promises his friend that he will bring Blue's daughter back to her before Blue runs off again.\n\nBeta is then transferred to Biosyn's headquarters in the Dolomite Mountains via a transfer plane in Malta, where she is held captive in Henry Wu's laboratory by Lewis Dodgson. When Maisie inquires why she was brought to Biosyn, she learns that in order to understand the pathogen used to save Maisie from the same genetic disorder her mother died from, they needed to examine both her and Beta, which Wu intends to use to kill the genetically modified giant locusts Dodgson made him create to destroy crops not made by Biosyn. After learning this, Maisie releases Beta, who causes havoc and knocks over the lab equipment before escaping into the lab's server rooms.\n\nBeta remains in hiding throughout this time and the chaos of Dodgson's attempt to burn the locusts and destroy the evidence to his crimes, which causes a forest fire and evacuation of the staff and dinosaurs in the sanctuary there, until Owen, Maisie, and Alan Grant come to find her. Agitated and scared, Beta tries to attack them, but Maisie, utilizing Owen's training, uses her adoptive father's techniques to keep Beta's attention with Alan's help until Owen tranquilizes her. They then carry the unconscious Beta out, strapped to Owen's back, where she remains until they escape Biosyn via helicopter.\n\nAfter a repentant Dr. Wu takes a sample of Beta's blood and Maisie's to stop the locusts, Owen, Claire, and Maisie return Beta home to Blue. Reunited with her mother, she runs off into the wilderness as Blue says goodbye to Owen before joining her daughter, both free at last."

Dr. Alan Grant heard their calls and attempted to imitate them to successful results. The following morning, a Brachiosaurus sick with a cold or a similar disease fed on the tree that the three humans were sleeping in, waking them up. Lex panicked at the sight of the dinosaur, believing it to be dangerous at first, but she soon calmed down when Dr. Alan Grant and her brother showed her that it was harmless. Dr. Grant fed the Brachiosaurus a nearby branch on the tree and Tim Murphy even pet it. However, when Lex attempted to pet the dinosaur like her brother did, the Brachiosaurus responded by sneezing on her.

				"scene_description": "When the inspection team constituting of vertebrate paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant, paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler, chaotician Dr. Ian Malcolm, lawyer Donald Gennaro, and John Hammond's grandchildren Lex and Tim Murphy took a tour of Jurassic Park, initially the Tyrannosaurus was a no-show. Although computer technician Ray Arnold attempted to lure her to her paddock fence by tantalizing her with a goat, the T. rex still refused to answer the call. Alan, observing this, surmised that it was because she wanted to hunt her prey rather than have it offered to her.\n\nLater that night, a tropical storm forced the tour to be turned around sometime after the group visited the Triceratops Paddock. During this time Dennis Nedry shut down all electricity to the park, causing the Ford Explorer Tour Vehicles to shut down in front of the T. rex's paddock with its electrified fencing in the same state. At this point, the T. rex revealed herself to the visitors by eating the goat left by the fence as bait, hunger probably having eclipsing her pride, and then touching the electric fence to see if her enclosure was still electrified. Gennaro, seeing that the fence was disabled left his Explorer and ran to the nearby restroom hut to hide. By that point, the T. rex moved to the disabled fence and ripped it apart with her teeth before stepping out onto the road and roaring triumphantly. After exploring and investigating the Explorers, her attention was caught by the light that was emitted from a flashlight that Lex had turned on in the front Explorer. Unaware that the source of the light was inside the Explorer, she walked right to the front door and peered out into the jungle in front of the Explorer. It was not until Tim slammed the open door next to the T. rex shut that she discovered the source of the light.\n\nNow confident that the light was coming from inside the Explorer and that there were interesting objects inside, the T. rex set to attacking the mysterious vehicle in front of her, searching for a way to get at Lex and Tim to eat them. After failing to get at them through the Explorer's skylight, she flipped the car over and proceeded to savage the undercarriage and right rear tire whilst crushing it under her massive foot. Thanks to the heroic efforts of Alan and Ian, the T. rex was briefly distracted. She followed Ian as he fled toward the Tyrannosaur Paddock Bathroom, where she injured the mathematician by flinging him into the air just as her head came crashing through the door, causing Ian to be buried in the wreckage as the shelter collapsed. The destruction of the building revealed the cowering Gennaro, whom she proceeded to devour while Alan rescued the kids inside the car. Before long, however, the T. rex returned and pushed the vehicle over the cliff while Tim was still inside and pushing Lex and Alan off the edge with the car, though the three survived.\n\nAs Robert Muldoon and Ellie were in the Tyrannosaur Paddock investigating the whereabouts of the survivors and had found Ian, the T. rex attacked the search party. Muldoon and Ellie had heard the T. rex roar several times before during the search and just before her ambush, Ian heard her footsteps. The T. rex attacked suddenly, without warning, crashing through a line of trees where she began chasing them through a tree lined corridor. After a very close chase, she was unsuccessful in catching them and so finally gave up, letting the trio escape to the Visitor Center.\n\nThe next day, during Alan, Tim, and Lex's continued trek to the Visitor Center, they found themselves in the Gallimimus Enclosure, where they witnessed a stampeding herd of Gallimimus. They ran alongside the dinosaurs momentarily before hiding behind a fallen log and watched as the herd was suddenly ambushed by the T. rex who came roaring out of the bushes in their path, stumbling a Gallimimus. This Gallimimus tried to run away, but was too slow to react, and the Tyrannosaur lunged at it, catching the dinosaur in her jaws before proceeding to shake the Gallimimus to death. Alan, Lex, and Tim watched in amazement as the T. rex started to feast on the carcass. Lex begged Alan for them to go, to which Alan obliged. However, Tim continued to stare in fascination and so had to be forcibly taken away by Alan. She never fully consumed this Gallimimus and its remains were still present in the location where it had died by October 6, 2002, almost a decade later.\n\nThe T. rex later made her way to the Visitor Center, entering the lobby through the uncompleted side and grabbed a Velociraptor from mid-air just as it was to pounce on Alan, Ellie, Tim, and Lex, then crushed it in her jaws. Using the distraction that she provided, the humans fled. Meanwhile, another raptor, the Big One pounced on the larger theropod. She snapped at her but could not reach her as the raptor continued to rip and tear madly. Rolling her head, the Big One fell into the T. rex's mouth where she was killed and then thrown against the Tyrannosaurus skeleton, bringing it down with a crash. Having conquered her prey, the T. rex let out a mighty bellow in triumph as the \"When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth\" banner fell to the ground."

Using a flare, Claire guided the T. rex to the Indominus and threw the flare at the hybrid. Crashing through Main Street's mounted Spinosaurus skeleton, the Tyrannosaurus challenged the I-rex with an almighty bellow, not knowing exactly what this new creature was but identifying it as a threat. When the hybrid did not back down, the T-rex attacked her viciously.\n\nInitially, the Tyrannosaurus had the advantage, landing several bites to the I. rex's neck, but the elder dinosaur was fighting from a territorial standpoint whilst the hybrid was aiming to kill and the tables were quickly turned, with the T-rex thrown down against the Jurassic Traders Outpost, destroying it in the process and almost killing Owen Grady, Gray, and Zach Mitchell.\n\nHowever, before the Indominus could kill her, Blue, the surviving Velociraptor of the battle, intervened by lunging onto the I. rex, giving the T. rex time to get up off the ground, now fighting to kill. With Blue latched onto the hybrid, the old T. rex grabbed the Indominus dragging her and slamming her body into the nearby buildings of Main Street. At one point, Blue rode on the tyrannosaur's back while she smashed the I. rex into one of the buildings. She finally flung the hybrid near the edge of the Jurassic World Lagoon where the Mosasaurus that resided there leaped out of the water to snatch the I-rex and drag it underwater, drowning the hybrid. After the fight, the T. rex and Blue looked at each other for a brief moment. Despite a previous animosity and hostile encounter with raptors, the T-rex decided to spare Blue either because she is too injured and exhausted, or because she doesn't see her as a threat. Either way, the old Tyrannosaurus limps away to recover from the injuries she sustained from the fight.\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, the T-rex stomped onto the Control Center helipad and took in the ruined park that had become void of any people, warming her wounds in the rising sun before letting out her signature roar, claiming the island as hers once again."

				"scene_description": "6 months after the incident at Jurassic World, the T. rex continued to run wild on the island with other surviving dinosaurs. One stormy night, a group of mercenaries was on Isla Nublar to retrieve a bone sample from the I. rex's remains at the bottom of the park's lagoon, which also still housed its surviving Mosasaurus. As they prepared to pick up one of their men, the T. rex entered their campsite located in the ruins of Main Street and proceeded to chase him, stepping on the tablet that controlled the gate which connected the lagoon to the ocean in the process. The T. rex chased the man towards the edge of the lagoon, but he got away by climbing onto the helicopter's ladder. Despite grabbing the ladder with her jaws and using her strength to pull her potential prey to her, the mercenaries got away, and the T. rex was left roaring into the night. The tablet that she stepped on prevented the doors of the lagoon from closing completely, allowing the Mosasaurus to escape into the open ocean.\n\nDuring the destruction of the island by the eruption of Mount Sibo, Owen and his group encountered her again, after she had inadvertently saved them from an attacking Carnotaurus, fatally subduing the meat-eating bull. She later left the dead Carnotaurus behind as the volcano erupted, with the shockwave from the eruption prompting her to flee the scene, followed by the other dinosaurs that caused a stampede. After Owen helped Claire and Franklin escape their sinking Gyrosphere and reached the shore, they spotted a helicopter carrying her thanks to the efforts of another team of mercenaries led by Ken Wheatley, proving that Eli Mills' claim of saving the dinosaurs was partially true. She and the other dinosaurs were loaded on to their cargo ship, the Arcadia, and took them to the Lockwood Manor as Isla Nublar burned.\n\nSometime later on, Owen and Claire found her sedated in a truck, where they needed to get some of her blood for transfusion for Blue, who had been shot awhile back by one of Wheatley's mercenaries. As they got some of her blood, Claire rode on the theropod’s back while trying to hand the blood bag to Owen. After being locked in by one of the mercenaries, Owen looked into the tyrannosaur's eye as she awoke from her sedation. Finding herself in an enclosed space with people around her, the mighty theropod started to freak out and broke free of her restraints, with Owen being forced to jump through her snapping jaws to get out of the truck.\n\nLater, the T. rex was lured to her cell located beneath the Lockwood estate with a goat in order have her prepared to be sold off to wealthy buyers in an auction set up by Eli Mills and Gunnar Eversol. However, some poisonous gas was released into the holding cell during Blue's brawl with some mercenaries, threatening to kill the dinosaurs yet again. The T. rex was eventually freed along with the other dinosaurs through Claire opening all the cell doors and Maisie, who had just lost her grandfather and learned of her true origin, opening the gate that set them all free and allowing the T.rex to escape the manor. Before she left the premises, however, the T. rex caught and ate Mills after, scaring off a lone Carnotaurus that had tried to join the feast. Finishing off what little remained of Mills, the T. rex then brought one of her massive feet down on the I. rex's only surviving bone fragment and DNA sample as she stomped off into the woods, crushing it to smithereens and with it any chance of other hybrids like her returning. After she escaped, the T. rex broke into a nearby zoo and roared at an male lion, who stood his ground by angrily roaring back at her"

                "scene_description": "In a 65 million years ago prequel scene, during the Late Cretaceous period, a feathered Tyrannosaurus fought a Giganotosaurus, but was swiftly killed in the battle. Immediately after its death, a mosquito fed off the body's blood, which would later be used in InGen's cloning of the species.\n\nBy 2022, the Department of Prehistoric Wildlife had reports of the Nublar T. rex in Sacramento, California, footage of a failed hunt on a Apatosaurus in Lake of the Woods, Oregon and tracks of the Tyrannosaur in the Prairie Creek Redwoods, also in California. Later that year, the Department of Fish and Wildlife attempted to hunt down the dinosaur by helicopter, and accidentally chased her into the SkyLine Drive-In Movie Theater. After both parties damaged multiple cars and the theater itself, the Tyrannosaurus escaped into the woods.\n\nAfter three years being chased by the DFW, Rexy was finally captured and taken to Biosyn's sanctuary in Italy. While scavenging a deer carcass that met its end at the claws of a Therizinosaurus, she encounters the clone of her old rival that was killed 65 million years ago, a Giganotosaurus. The pair had a brief tussle over the carcass until the Tyrannosaurus backed off, allowing the Giganotosaurus to feed on the carcass.\n\nLater that night, a swarm of giant locusts that was set on fire by Lewis Dodgson in an attempt to erase his criminal activity escaped their containment and started a forest fire within the valley. As the fire worsened, Biosyn used the chips they implanted in their animals to call them into the center of the Biosyn Research Facility. As it moved through the area, the T. rex came upon the Giganotosaurus and challenged it once more, and the two began battling. Rexy was knocked unconscious by the Giganotosaurus (almost the same way her ancestor lost to the same species 65 million years ago) after a ferocious melee that nearly crushed the humans, and her limp body, held underfoot by the larger animal, had pinned a sheet of metal on top of Owen, Claire, Maisie, and Ramsay and was about to crush them.\n\nEllie saw this and attempted to help them, but the Giganotosaurus roared at her when she attempted to approach and prepared to attack. Kayla then shot a flare to distract the large theropod, which landed beside a newcomer; the Therizinosaurus. The two dinosaurs fought each other, with the aggressive herbivore landing effective slashing blows on the larger theropod until Rexy regained consciousness. Now finding itself cornered, the Giganotosaurus was unable to determine quickly enough which enemy was the greater threat, which allowed the Tyrannosaurus to bite its neck and ram it into the claws of the Therizinosaurus, impaling the predator in the neck and body before it eventually died seconds after it dropped to the ground.\n\nAbout a month later, Rexy encounters the Buck and Doe from Isla Sorna in Biosyn valley, which has now declared a dinosaur sanctuary by the United Nations."

A juvenile Dilophosaur stalked Nedry himself when he tried to get his vehicle unstuck out of a fallen tree limb. Feeling uneasy, Nedry stopped rope towing his jeep to face his stalker that was right behind him. Dennis Nedry tried to trick the dangerous dinosaur into fetching a stick for him, but the Dilophosaurus showed little care for the stick outside of the brief sound it made when it hit the forest floor. Angered that his trick was unsuccessful, Dennis Nedry jeered the Dilophosaur before running back to his jeep. However, when he turned around, the \"Dilo\" was there, and it popped up its frill before spraying venom at Nedry. It landed on his raincoat, and Nedry ran to his vehicle. But before he could get in, another shot by the Dilophosaur hit him straight in the eyes. Poor Dennis managed to get in his vehicle, but he lost the counterfeit shaving cream can that held the dinosaur embryos he stole. When he shut the door, he realized with horror the \"Dilo\" was inside, and it proceeded to devour him.\n\nIt was confirmed on the DPG website that all five Dilophosaurs residing on Nublar during the Jurassic Park incident had survived to 1994 at least. Wild populations existed on Isla Sorna after Hurricane Clarissa struck the island because Dilophosaurus was among one of the information sheets given to the InGen Hunters during the Isla Sorna Incident and was also a screensaver for one of the computers inside the Fleetwood RV Mobile Lab that was used in the same incident."

				"scene_description": "The Pteranodon family living in the Isla Sorna Aviary had a major skirmish with the surviving humans involved in the incident. One of the adults detected the human visitors' presence in its enclosure as they crossed the bridge that connects the observatory to the Isla Sorna Aviary so they could get in the barge below. The adult pterosaur decided to land on the bridge when it was Eric Kirby's time to cross. Eric let out a scream of terror just before breaking into a sprint when the Pteranodon emerged from the thick fog surrounding the back of the laboratory to the front of the aviary.\n\nThe large pterosaur responded by snatching Eric Kirby and flying off as his group were racing towards the situation. The pterosaur carried the young human to a rock platform near its nest filled with baby Pteranodons chirping out of hunger. With the hungry babies setting their sights on him, leaving Eric to quarrel with the Pteranodons.\n\nEventually, the juvenile Pteranodons swarmed around him, but there was hope for Eric because Billy Brennan descended towards the nesting area to save the boy using the recovered paraglider of the now-deceased Ben Hildebrand and was calling to him. The baby Pteranodons bit tightly on Eric Kirby's jacket, focused on the appeal rather than their main target, allowing Eric to use this to his advantage by giving his jacket over to the hungry Pteranodons and leaping to a platform behind him afterward. Though as soon as he reached his destination, he found there was nowhere else to flee to, allowing the juvenile pterosaurs to continue attacking him.\n\nThankfully for Eric Kirby, Billy Brennan was coming close to the stone platform he was on, wanting Eric to jump to him. Eric was eager to escape his attackers so he swiped the Pteranodons off of him and he successfully clung to Billy soon afterward. The Pteranodon juveniles ceased their pursuit as Eric Kirby drifted away with his rescuer, but there was one that continued the chase and managed to grasp itself onto Eric's back. However, the pterosaur's grip was not very firm and it soon fell off as Billy made sharp turns as he glided. Despite being rescued by Billy Brennan, the boy was not safe from danger. As the two paraglided, three adult Pteranodons followed them with one making a minor tear in their parachute. This attack made Billy demand Eric let go of him and jump safely into the water below.\n\nConcurrent to the events mentioned above, Dr. Alan Grant, Amanda, and Paul Kirby were racing through the aviary's walkway trying to reach Eric. But they were put to a halt when they reached a section of the walkway that was completely missing. This gave an adult Pteranodon the chance to strike them. It tried getting through the open passageway, but its large wingspan and head crest wouldn't allow it to fit through. So it decided to fly up and land on the top of one of the sections of the passageway that was slightly damaged and slide its beak through hoping to bite one of the fleeing humans. Because of its weight, the roof of the passage collapsed, getting the Pteranodon inside the walkway. As the flying reptile cornered its prey to the end of the hallway, the section they were in collapsed from the added weight of the pterosaur, plunging both the humans and the Pteranodon into the water below. The pterosaur quickly reached by emerging to prepare itself for flight, but was pushed back into the river by the falling segment it unwillingly helped detach.\n\nAs Billy Brennan glided away from any of the airborne reptiles chasing him, his paraglider became snagged on a bulging nearby rock face. With their prey in a weak position, two Pteranodons began to circle around him like buzzards, preparing to strike. Billy freed himself by removing his harness and fell into the riverbank below, but he was not free from the sight of the Pterosaurs. Dr. Alan Grant and Paul Kirby, who had just reached dry land, reunited with Eric Kirby and watched Billy from afar, rushed to rescue him.\n\nOnce they reached Billy's position, a Pteranodon snatched him, but it lost grip of its prey seconds after grabbing him, only for a second Pteranodon to pin him to the rock bed of the river. Though, like the previous attack, Brennan broke free from his attackers' grasp. As the pterosaurs attacked him, Billy demanded that the two group members not try saving him. After one final plea, the two pterosaurs that had pursued Billy relentlessly assaulted him at the same time and proceeded to viciously maul him as his body drifted down the river. However, Brennan somehow survived the lacerations the Pteranodons gave him and he was later rescued by the Marines at the end of the incident.\n\nA third Pteranodon began to chase Dr. Alan Grant and Paul Kirby as Billy was mauled. But when it tried to snatch one of the humans, they both dived into the deep waters of the river where they swam to the barge and the rest of their group. The Pteranodon followed in pursuit but was blocked by one of the metal walls of the Aviary. While the two men went to save Billy, Eric and Amanda Kirby unlocked the door to the Isla Sorna Aviary to escape it. After the two unlocked the door, Amanda soon relocked it, though unknown to her it soon reverted back when she and the other survivors rushed to get to the boat.\n\nThe three Pteranodon adults escaped their enclosure after the humans had left. For some reason, they abandoned their young. This could have been because they didn't know how expansive the world was outside of the Aviary or thought the fourth Pteranodon would take care of the juveniles, which seems unlikely after the section of the walkway fell on it. The survivors and the Marines/Navy who had rescued them saw the three Pterosaurs as they flew away from Isla Sorna. When asked by Dr. Grant why the flying reptiles were leaving their home, Dr. Grant suggested that they were looking for new nesting grounds. The survivors hardly showed concern for the escaped pterosaurs, focusing on the joy of being rescued.\n\nThe escaped Pteranodons traveled a long distance, reaching Canada before they were \"cleaned up\" by Vic Hoskins and his InGen Security Division team. How the situation was handled impressed Simon Masrani who had bought out InGen several years before and had plans to make his own dinosaur park. He decided to appoint Vic to a high position in the InGen Security Division to reinvent the security firm."

After Lewis Dodgson burns the Giant Locusts whom escape and cause a forest fire, Pteranodons were evacuated into the headquarters alongside many other dinosaurs and pterosaurs, with one flying next to another Dreadnoughtus and an Iguanodon. It can be assumed that the Pteranodons now resides in the wild or they might be continuing their lives in the abandoned sanctuary which is now a global sanctuary. A flock of Pteranodons are seen at the end of the movie migrating alongside three Quetzalcoatlus and other migratory birds, such as geese and ducks."

				"scene_description": "During his time lost on Isla Sorna Eric Kirby learned that though Tyrannosaurus rex urine can scare off small dinosaurs like Compsognathus, it can also attract Spinosaurus, which reinforces the territoriality of Spinosaurus in relation to Tyrannosaurus.\n\nAmanda Kirby, Eric's mother, apparently attracted a Spinosaurus that would follow her and her group throughout the incident by shouting her missing son's name through a megaphone. Cooper, one of the mercenaries hired by the Kirby family, spotted the large dinosaur and began to fire his rifle at it as his fellow mercenaries, Udesky and M.B. Nash, fled the area. The attack failed to stop the Spinosaurus and the dinosaur injured its attacker's arm. This caused Cooper's group to desperately attempt to leave the island in their plane.\n\nCooper ran in front of the plane as it taxied down the airstrip, and tried to convince Nash to stop the plane. The Spinosaurus quickly emerged to the right of the wounded mercenary and proceeded to devour him just as the plane prepared to lift off. The airplane collided with the Spinosaurus's flank just seconds after it takes the life of its first victim. The collision dealt nothing more than a minor injury to the large theropod, though the plane crashed into a tree in the surrounding jungle.\n\nThe Spinosaurus soon quickly found the rest of Cooper's group inside the damaged airplane, removed the cockpit and grabbed Nash's leg with its strong jaws. Nash desperately fought against the Spinosaurus grip by grabbing Amanda Kirby's legs but despite his and Udesky's efforts, he was swiftly pulled out of the plane and killed as he tried to crawl away. The Spinosaurus gave out a loud roar that shook the plane violently until it fell out of the tree and onto the ground below. With the passengers now under its feet, the Spinosaurus continued its rampage. The Spinosaurus then proceeded to roll the already damaged airplane towards itself, flatten it with its foot and rammed its head into the remaining portion, searching for the humans inside. Dr. Alan Grant and his team fled from the wreckage the Spinosaurus was scavenging, hoping it would lose sight of them. The Spinosaurus was quick to follow and began to chase them throughout the jungle only to be stopped by a patch of trees that temporarily blocked it from continuing its pursuit. The Spinosaurus managed to make its way around the blockage and met up with its prey soon afterward fleeing from the Tyrannosaurus.\n\nA conflict ensued as soon as the Spinosaurus and the Tyrannosaurus rex saw one another. The Tyrannosaurus was the first to strike, he clamped down on the Spinosaurus' neck using his strong jaws, pinning it to the ground. Nonetheless, the Spinosaurus briskly got back on its feet and broke free of the Tyrannosaurus grip, taking the chance to try and bite its opponent's flanks, with the T. rex doing the same as well. The T. rex then decided to charge headfirst into the Spinosaurus, pushing it forward, though this left him vulnerable to its next strike. The Spinosaurus bit down on the Tyrannosaurus neck, proceeded to grab it with its powerful forearms and snapped it, killing the Tyrannosaurus rex. The Spinosaurus roared triumphantly as it claimed the carcass of its recent kill. The battle allowed the human visitors to finally escape from the vicious Spinosaurus, but they would encounter the giant theropod several times throughout the incident.\n\nWhen the Spinosaurus consumed the mercenaries, their clothes and gear were undigested. The most notable of the objects was Paul Kirby's satellite phone that he gave to Nash that would ring inside its stomach. Eric Kirby, who had just met Alan Grant, heard this ringing of his father's satellite phone and assumed his family was in the area. Though he and Dr. Alan Grant did indeed reunite with his family on the opposite sides of the Isla Sorna Aviary observatory's large perimeter fence, they all were soon aware of the Spinosaurus's presence behind them after they realized that Paul lacked his phone.\n\nAs soon as the recently reunited group saw the Spinosaurus it began to chase Eric and Alan, but the two reached the other side of the fence by crawling through a hole that was in it. For a brief moment, the predator seemed to have been detoured, unable to get past the fence, until the Spinosaurus smashed through the perimeter fence. With their only means of defense against the Spinosaurus penetrated, Dr. Alan Grant, the Kirby family, and his colleague Billy Brennan fled towards the Isla Sorna Field Lab. Once inside, Paul Kirby and Alan Grant barricaded the doors right before the Spinosaurus could get inside. Unlike the fence that surrounded the laboratory, the doors successfully prevented the Spinosaurus from penetrating them. Uninterested, the dinosaur soon left.\n\nThe group later reacquired the satellite phone from scavenging through the Spinosaurus's dung that contained the remains of Nash and Cooper. The smell of the large predator's dung discouraged a Ceratosaurus from potentially attacking them.\n\nThe Spinosaurus made one last attempt at killing the humans before the incident ended by stalking their boat they used to escape from the Isla Sorna Aviary from its inhabitants during a thunderstorm that began at night. It swam silently, hidden beneath the deep waters of the river that were rising as the rain from the storm fell, the only indication of its presence being the native Bonitos swimming away in fear of it and the tip of its sail emerging from the water. The Spinosaurus began its attack by ramming into the back of the boat, emerged from the water, and proceeded to severely damage the boat's center console and the fuel tank, causing it to leak rapidly.\n\nThe Kirby family and Alan Grant locked themselves in a large cage on the watercraft for protection from the rampage of the Spinosaurus. However, their attempt was rendered futile when the Spinosaurus pulled the cage into the water, nearly drowning the people inside as it became submerged. While the Spinosaurus thrashed in the water searching for them, the entrapment landed on some rocks, allowing the top portion of the enclosure to surface and giving the trapped humans the oxygen they needed, though the dinosaur quickly used this to its advantage. It put its arm in the cage and grabbed Amanda Kirby, preparing to kill her. Her husband, Paul, who swam out of the cage once it submerged, successfully distracted the predator by shouting from a half-submerged crane he had just climbed. This, in turn, allowed the others to escape the cage.\n\nWith Paul Kirby gaining its full attention, the Spinosaurus responded to his calls by giving the crane two nudges with its head, causing Paul Kirby to almost fall into the raging river below, dangling with nothing else to hold on to. Afterward, Dr. Alan Grant found the boat's flare gun in the riverbed near the entrapment and shot the Spinosaurus with it. The flare did nothing of harm to its target but once it fell into the water it ignited the petroleum that had leaked out of the boat and into the river. Afraid of the fire surrounding it, the Spinosaurus fled the area as the crane collapsed around it, ending its involvement in the Isla Sorna Incident of 2001."

				"scene_description": "Two I. rex were meant to be kept in their own paddock that had walls with a height of 12 meters (40 feet). This was also planned in case one of them died. However, the older Indominus cannibalized her own sibling and would also attack the workers of her paddock as well. Three weeks before their paddock was open to the public, Simon Masrani visited the paddock. He had not been able to do so for many months due to him being needed for several meeting and events. At the time of his visit, the lone Indominus was not fully grown and was only 12.2 meters (40 ft). Simon told Claire Dearing to consult Owen Grady to see if he was interested in taking a job requiring him to inspect the paddock for any vulnerabilities after seeing her attempt of breaking the glass in the observation deck.\n\nThat same day, the Indominus later managed to avoid her temperature being picked up by the thermal cameras thanks to the frog DNA in her species and left claw marks on the walls to make them think she was able to climb over the enclosure's wall. When Owen Grady, paddock supervisor Nicholas Letting and worker Nick Kilgore came in to investigate the damaged paddock, the hybrid ambushed them as soon as they got word that she was still in the paddock, making a quick meal out of Kilgore in the process. As they fled, she managed to break through the door as it was not fully shut. Free at last, the I. rex managed to detect and eat Letting, but Owen evaded her by hiding under a nearby crane outside of her paddock and then cut the crane's fuel tank, masking his scent. The Indominus rex then headed off toward the Jurassic World park, attracted by the thermal signatures of the visitors there.\n\nThe Indominus then came across a group of campers from Camp Cretaceous. After killing a Brachiosaurus and two employees trying to warn them, the Indominus tried to get Darius Bowman, Brooklynn, Ben Pincus, Kenji Kon, Sammy Gutierrez and Yasmina Fadoula by tearing down the observation deck they were on. However the campers managed to elude her by using a zipline to escape. It then tore apart their campground before coming across a caged Carnotaurus named Toro and used its great strength to tear down the fence, setting him free.\n\nHer escape was not reported to Jurassic World visitors because Simon Masrani thought the Asset Containment Unit would capture her by following her tracker implant. The I. rex traveled south of her paddock having detected the thermal signatures of the visitors in Main Street. She managed to claw out her tracker, along with some flesh still attached to it, and ambushed the team as soon as they arrived, killing most of the troopers, including Katashi Hamada, Craig, and other members of the team, convincing Owen that the island needed to be evacuated.\n\nThis Indominus might have been responsible for opening one of the Gyrosphere Valley's fences to the Restricted Area of Isla Nublar.\n\nShe then found brothers, Zach and Gray Mitchell, who were observing four Ankylosaurus in the island's Restricted Area after traveling through the opened gate and attacked the two. In her attack, she agitated one of the Ankylosaurus who proceeded to fight back against her though her counterattack ended with her being killed by the Indominus via rolling her onto her back and breaking her neck. She resumed attacking the two brothers by piercing her mid talon into the glass and rotated the vehicle so the boys could see their demise. She then attempted to chomp the Gyrosphere whole but got her mouth stuck. She attempted to smash it several times into the ground to crack it open, but the two brothers escaped by getting out of their damaged Gyrosphere and jumping off a waterfall. She gave out a loud roar in disappointment and headed to the Gyrosphere Valley.\n\nThe Indominus soon encountered the kids from Camp Cretaceous again, along with Bumpy, a young Ankylosaurus, found an abandoned ACU van. Because he had a learner's permit, Kenji was able to drive it. The kids barely escaped from the pursuing hybrid by driving off a cliff and down a steep incline, seeking refuge in a private lab operated by Dr. Wu. Wu's assistant Eddie, who was hiding in the lab, stole the van and abandoned the children, only to be waylaid by Indominus who knocked the van off the road and killed him. After this, the kids found a second van parked nearby and were able to escape in that, despite the I. rex chasing them.\n\nShortly afterward, the Indominus attacked a herd of Apatosaurus, killing five and fatally injuring one before moving on into the restricted area of Isla Nublar, leaving their bodies uneaten. While in the restricted area, the I. rex discovered Owen Grady and Claire Dearing inside the Visitor Center to which she took the opportunity to attack and chase them after pretending not to notice them and breaking through the ceiling. However, her pursuit of the humans ended when she saw the JW001 piloted by Masrani outfitted with a heavy machine gun in pursuit of her. She led her pursuer to the Jurassic World Aviary where she smashed through the enclosure's walls and scared the pterosaurs inside out of the aviary to the open hole she created. This was witnessed from afar by both Claire Dearing and Owen Grady as well as the Camp Cretaceous kids, who'd crashed their second van into a boulder. As the freed pterosaurs led to the destruction of JW001 and attacked the guests in Main Street, the Indominus traveled further into the restricted area of the island.\n\nThat night in the restricted area the members of Jurassic World's Velociraptor pack found her. However, when she began communicating with the raptors, Owen realized and remarked that the Indominous was part raptor. She became the alpha of their pack. As the leader of the pack, she commanded the raptors that were under her control to attack the humans that came with them and were in the area, to which they followed this order. Upon the initiation of this order, the InGen Security troopers, Owen, and Barry Sembène, who were following the Velociraptors opened fire on the hybrid. She managed to escape the brawl that ensued as the small arms fire had little to no effect on her, but she did nearly collapse on the ground when she was hit by a rocket from one of the troopers while escaping.\n\nThe I. rex finally arrived in Main Street where she met Owen, Claire, the Mitchell brothers, and the three remaining raptors once again, commanding the raptors to finish them off. Owen successfully attempts to regain Blue's trust by removing her camera only seconds before the hybrid's arrival. Blue once again regards Owen as her alpha. Blue screeches at the I. rex, shortly before it responded by knocking her into a wall, seemingly killing her. The raptors, now aligned with Owen's group again, proceeded to jump on and attack the Indominus while Owen provided extra fire, albeit ineffective fire, with his rifle. But the fight ends fairly quickly after the Indominus easily kills Delta by tossing her into a grill, incinerating her, and snatches and throws Echo away. With the raptors defeated, the Indominus rex then proceeded to resume hunting Owen and the Mitchell brothers who were huddled inside the Jurassic Traders Outpost, one of Main Street's shops. She nearly dragged Gray to her, but was stopped when Claire threw a flare at her, which then caused her to turn her attention to another dinosaur who challenged her: Jurassic World's veteran Tyrannosaurus rex.\n\nThe T. rex carried out a heavy assault on Indominus, and the two dinosaurs engaged in a ferocious battle. Though the T. rex initially dominated the fight, she was eventually brought to the ground by the hybrid's strength, destroying the Jurassic Traders Outpost and almost killing Owen Grady, Gray, and Zach. The Indominus almost delivered the killing blow before she was attacked by Blue who was still alive from the onslaught. This allowed the tyrant to return to her feet and grab the I. rex by the neck, pushing her into many of Main Street's buildings, all while Blue assisted the Tyrannosaurus. Finally, she was flung to the edge of the Jurassic World Lagoon. The attacks from both the T. rex and Blue were so heavy that it caused the hybrid to actually bleed and pieces of metal were even sticking out of the left side of her torso. The I. rex got back up from the ground, however, still ready to fight the theropods once more. While she let out a roar, the lagoon's resident Mosasaurus detected the hybrid and proceeded to emerge out of the water to pull the I. rex under the water to her death."

Some time afterwards, the pair managed to escape the market and rampaged through the city, with the Allosaurus eating at least one man on an electric scooter when the Carnotaurus distracted him."

				"scene_description": "During Maisie Lockwood's sneaking into the laboratory sub-level where Dr. Wu and Eli Mills were conversing over the Indoraptor's faults, Maisie hid in a darkened hallway that led to the Indoraptor's cage. Unknowingly getting too close with her back to the hybrid's enclosure, she did not see the Indoraptor reach out to try and grab her, only to be alerted when one of his claws brushed her ponytail, causing her to run away screaming, leading to her being caught and confined to her room by Mills.\n\nDuring the Lockwood Manor Auction, the Indoraptor was introduced to a crowd of wealthy people who've come from all over the world to buy the dinosaurs who were evacuated from Isla Nublar. Unfortunately, the dinosaur isn't up for auction as he's only in the prototype stage, but it doesn’t stop the audience from bidding tremendous amounts of money on the hybrid. Gunnar Eversol begins to accept bids at the behest of Eli Mills, with Russian mobster Anton Orlov winning the bid. Owen Grady then shows up with a Stygimoloch and together they cause havoc, with Owen and the Indoraptor sharing a close glance at one another.\n\nThe place empties, leaving only Ken Wheatley with the Indoraptor. He attempts to sedate the dinosaur, shooting him twice with tranquilizer darts, causing him to fall over, seemingly incapacitated. He then enters his cage with the plan of taking one of his teeth for his collection.\n\nThe Indoraptor turns out to only be faking his sedation, and remains motionless for a brief time. He then smirks just before he rises, literally disarms Ken, and begins to maul and kill him. He escapes from the cage and then his tail breaks the elevator that Gunnar Eversol along with three other members from the auction were trying to escape in.\n\nThe Indoraptor roars at Gunnar Eversol as he kills him and the other members off-screen. Moments later, he attacked and killed two of Eli Mill's guards. Owen Grady, Claire Dearing, and Maisie Lockwood run into the Indoraptor while trying to cross the main floor in the Lockwood Manor.\n\nHe chases after them and separates Maisie from Claire and Owen, injuring Claire in the process. The Indoraptor pursues Maisie as she runs towards her bedroom. He then climbs into her room through the window and is about to snatch her from her bed when Owen shows up, armed with a gun he'd taken from a dead mercenary. He fires two rounds at the Dinosaur but it doesn't do much, bar stunning him for a brief time. As he approaches Owen, ready to attack, Blue arrives and begins to assault him, keeping him occupied while Owen and Maisie escape through the window.\n\nThe Indoraptor pushes Blue out the window, with the two being separated from their fight, and he corners Owen and Maisie on the roof. Claire arrives behind it and points a laser at Owen, prompting him to attack, in an attempt to get him to fall through weakened glass. He moves and begins to fall through the glass roof, but manages to save and haul himself back up.\n\nThe Indoraptor then recovers and moves to lunge towards Owen when Blue arrives once more and resumes her attack, with both tumbling through the glass in a deadlock grapple. Once they land, the Indoraptor gets impaled by the brow horns of a Agujaceratops skull and perishes within seconds. Blue sprints away, triumphant, with the body of the hybrid being left behind on the ceratopsian skull.\n\nIt is unknown what happened with the hybrid’s body, but he was most likely disposed of, alongside the technology to create more Indoraptors in the fallout of his escape."

At least one adult individual was housed in Biosyn's sanctuary. The corporation's sanctuary has an Aerial Deterrent System (ADS), which keeps pterosaurs safely below 500 ft and away from inbound and outbound aircraft. However, the ADS was disabled when Kayla's plane entered Biosyn's airspace. The Quetzalcoatlus attacked Owen, Claire, and Kayla on the plane on their way to Biosyn headquarters. Quetzalcoatlus were part of the animals that escape the forest fire caused by engineering locusts. At the end of the film, three Quetzalcoatlus were seen flying with a flock of Pteranodons and birds."

                "scene_description": "During the Cretaceous period, a Giganotosaurus rested a while a Moros scavenged morsels of meat stuck between the teeth of Giganotosaurus until a Tyrannosaurus approached the pair, causing the Giganotosaurus to confront the intruder and scaring away the Moros and a nearby Iguanodon. The carnivores circled and roared at each other until a fight broke out, with the Giganotosaurus quickly managing to bite the neck of its opponent and sliced it. After slicing the throat of the corpse and dumping it off a small cliff, the Giganotosaurus left the area.\n\nBy 2022, at least a single Giganotosaurus was among the dinosaurs cloned by Biosyn and kept within their valley. At some point, the Giganotosaurus had a chip inserted into its brain, allowing it to be controlled when needed.\n\nWhile Ellie Sattler, Alan Grant, and Ramsay Cole were heading towards Biosyn Valley, the Giganotosaurus slept peacefully as it was approached by a Moros. Later that day, Owen Grady and Kayla Watts witnessed the Giga encounter the clone of its old rival that was killed 65 million years ago, Rexy, the elderly Tyrannosaurus rex who was recently transported to the Biosyn Valley, scavenging a carcass of a deer that met its end at the claws of a Therizinosaurus. The pair had a brief tussle over the carcass until the Tyrannosaurus backed off, allowing the Giganotosaurus to feed on the carcass. That night, a swarm of giant locusts that was set on fire by Lewis Dodgson in an attempt to erase his criminal activity escaped their containment and started a forest fire within the valley, during which the Giganotosaurus encountered Owen, Claire Dearing, Alan, Ian Malcolm, Ellie, Maisie Lockwood, and Kayla at an observation tower near its habitat and attacked them. At first the predator only followed them slowly until Maisie attempted to climb a ladder into the observation tower, at which point it bit down on the railing around the ladder and tore it off. Before it could turn back to its quarry, Malcolm got its attention by waving a flaming locust on a bar of metal, which he threw into the predators mouth as it attempted to lunge at him, stunning the dinosaur and briefly setting its mouth on fire. As the theropod briefly writhed in pain, flames from the burning locust shot out of its mouth, similar to a dragon. The large predator quickly turned back to the group however, who had all made it to a platform that looped around the tower, and proceeded to bite the platform and attempt to pull it down with Owen and Ellie, but all of the humans made it inside, prompting the Giga to smash the glass of the tower and attempt to reach the group. Owen began stabbing the dinosaur with metal knives and broken pipes and Claire electrocuted its eye with a taser after Kayla shot it in the face with a tranquilizer dart, which forced the carnivore to retreat.\n\nAs the fire worsened, Biosyn used the chips they implanted in their animals to call them into the center of the Biosyn Research Facility. As it moved through the area, the Giganotosaurus was challenged by the old T. rex once more, and the two began battling. The Giganotosaurus managed to knock Rexy unconscious after a ferocious melee that nearly crushed the humans, and the T. rex's limp body, held underfoot by the larger animal, had pinned a sheet of metal on top of Owen, Claire, Maisie, and Ramsay and was about to crush them. Ellie saw this and attempted to help them, but the Giganotosaurus roared at her when she attempted to approach and prepared to attack. Kayla then shot a flare to distract the large theropod, which landed beside a newcomer; the Therizinosaurus. The two dinosaurs fought each other, with the aggressive herbivore landing effective slashing blows on the larger theropod until Rexy regained consciousness. Now finding itself cornered, the Giganotosaurus was unable to determine quickly enough which enemy was the greater threat, which allowed the Tyrannosaurus to bite its neck and ram it into the claws of the Therizinosaurus, impaling the predator in the neck and body before it eventually died seconds after it dropped to the ground."

                "scene_description": "By 2022, Atrociraptors were bred as trained hunting animals bred for speed. Proclaimed as \"designer dinosaurs\", Atrociraptors were bred with multiple color schemes per individual. Soyona Santos bred and trained at least one pack made up of four individuals named Ghost, Tiger, Red, and Panthera. The pack was shipped by Santos to Malta, where she planned to have Rainn Delacourt ship them abroad to Riyadh. During the exchange, however, a squad of French Intelligence Agents, including Barry Sembène, along with Owen Grady, ambushed the exchange and chased down the truck, eventually knocking it off the road and causing it to slam part way through a wall and send the Atrociraptors' cages flying.\n\nAs the agents moved in to arrest Santos and her driver, Santos ordered the driver to release the raptors, and sent them to kill the agents as she made her escape. As Santos was escaping, Claire Dearing tracked her down and got into a fight with her, but as Claire was questioning her, Santos called Tiger into the room and marked Claire with the laser. Claire ran out of the building and onto the roof of a lower floor with Tiger behind her, the two jumping between buildings during the chase. Meanwhile, the Atrociraptors made short work of almost all of the agents, but as Red had cornered Barry inside of a boat, Owen managed to sneak in, open the boat's sun roof, and help Barry out. The two got down and made up a plan to catch Red by tricking it into running back into its cage.\n\nSantos then returned to the scene, where Barry arrested her at gunpoint, but as he did so, she managed to mark Owen, which sent both Ghost and Panthera after him. In the meantime, while being pursued by Tiger, Claire falls on a truck trailer before being helped by Kayla Watts who then drives through the city with the raptor in pursuit, until Claire uses a metal bar, sticking it between two cars as the dinosaur relentlessly chases them before hitting itself in the throat on the bar, becoming incapacitated in the process. Later, Owen arrives as Kayla begins to start her plane, still chased by Ghost and Panthera, with the latter tripping on its way to try and reach the man, leaving Ghost to be the only one pursuing Owen, who narrowly gets aboard the plane with his motorbike, followed by the dinosaur. However, the plane takes off and Owen is caught by Claire as he begins slipping. The bike then slips too and slams Ghost out of the plane, with the couple watching as the raptor plummets into the sea."

After ejecting from a crashing plane, Claire Dearing encountered the Therizinosaurus as she was hanging from the seat and parachute she ejected in. The dinosaur at first failed to notice her due to its blindness, and moving instead to fatally swat a nearby deer it heard and begin grazing. Claire used this opportunity to unbuckle and fall to the ground, but the crash alerted the Therizinosaurus to her presence. The Therizinosaurus began stalking around in search of Claire as she crawled into a pond. Claire eventually managed to get far enough in the pond to fully submerge herself until the dinosaur left.\n\nThe Therizinosaurus would be evacuated to the Biosyn compound after Lewis Dodgson tried to dispose of his bio-engineered locusts, causing a huge forest fire in the valley. During the rampage of Giganotosaurus and fight with the Tyrannosaurus known as Rexy, Kayla Watts used a flare to distract the Giganotosaurus away from her and the evacuating Owen Grady, Claire Dearing, Maisie Lockwood, Alan Grant, Ellie Sattler, Ian Malcolm, Ramsay Cole, and Henry Wu, causing its attention to focus on the Therizinosaurus as it followed the flare after the Giganotosaurus succeeded in knocking the tyrannosaur unconscious. The Therizinosaurus was quick to fight back when confronted, delivering slashing wounds to the larger carcharodontosaurid, but lost a claw on its left hand to the Giganotosaurus' bites. When Rexy regained consciousness, the Giganotosaurus was unable to determine quickly enough which enemy was the greater threat, allowing Rexy to ram the Giganotosaurus onto the Therizinosaurus' claws, killing it."

After Owen Grady and Kayla Watts crashed landed into the lake, they encountered the Pyroraptor as they attempted to move towards the dam. The Pyroraptor slowly moved towards the pair, but as the ice cracked further beneath their weight it used a hole within the ice to dive underwater, circling them at first and pursuing them when they ran. During the pursuit, Owen fell through a hole in the ice, but before the Pyroraptor could reach him Kayla managed to pull him out. With that the Pyroraptor burst from the hole and attempted to run down Kayla and Owen, with all three climbing onto a walkway on the dam and racing towards an elevator. Owen and Kayla managed to get into the elevator and shut it on the Pyroraptor, who clawed at the door even after being tazed by Kayla and the elevator beginning its descent."
